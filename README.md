## About
Grails is inspired by my love for sneakers and the popular GOAT app. It is currently a platform for buying sneakers, with selling feature under development. Client users can browse sneakers, add them to cart, purchase, and view their order history. Admin users can add products and set up sneaker brands and categories.
